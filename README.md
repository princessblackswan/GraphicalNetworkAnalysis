### GraphicalLassoCV and Affinity Propagation for Securities Analysis

#### Introduction
This repository explores the use of Graphical LassoCV and Affinity Propagation techniques to analyze relationships between securities and enhance portfolio diversification. These methods are powerful tools for understanding the underlying structure and dependencies within a set of securities, which can lead to more informed investment decisions.

#### Graphical LassoCV
Graphical LassoCV, a part of the scikit-learn library, is a method for estimating the precision matrix (inverse of the covariance matrix) of a set of securities. It helps uncover conditional dependencies between securities by removing the effects of all other variables. This allows us to identify hidden or conditional relationships that might not be evident from a traditional correlation matrix. In practice, it can lead to more effective diversification strategies and improved portfolio performance.

#### Affinity Propagation
Affinity Propagation is a clustering algorithm that groups securities based on their return profiles. It considers both the similarity and dissimilarity between securities to form clusters, making it suitable for identifying assets with similar behavior. By clustering securities with similar returns, we can better understand their relationships and allocate assets within a portfolio more strategically.

#### How These Techniques Help
* Hidden Dependencies: Graphical LassoCV helps uncover hidden dependencies between securities by estimating the precision matrix. This allows us to understand how one security's behavior is influenced by others, even when correlations are weak or masked by noise.
* Diversification: By identifying clusters of securities with Affinity Propagation, we can group assets that exhibit similar returns. Diversifying a portfolio across these clusters can reduce risk and enhance the Sharpe Ratio, ultimately improving the risk-return profile of the investment.
